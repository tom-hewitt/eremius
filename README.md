# Eremius

an assembler, emulator, and debugger for a subset of the ARM assembly language

### ðŸš§ This project is a work in progress ðŸš§

- âœ… The assembler is (mostly!) complete for the chosen subset of the specification.
- ðŸš§ The emulator is in the middle of a rewrite to align its functionality with the exact behaviour specified in the ARM manual, so isn't currently fully functional.
- ðŸš§ There is an accompanying browser-based debugger that is currently in a different repository - I'm working on polishing it up and then I'm planning to integrate the entire project into a single monorepo.

Feel free to get in touch or raise a github issue, and check back soon for updates!

## Operands
### Shifter Operands
There are 4 types of shifter operands:

| Format                        | Name                          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `#<immediate>`                | Immediate                     |
| `<Rm>`                        | Register                      |
| `<Rm>, <shift> #<shift_imm>`  | Register Shift By Immediate   |
| `<Rm>, <shift> <Rs>`          | Register Shift By Register    |

### Load/Store Address Operands
All addressing modes involve a base register and an offset.

There are 3 types of offset value:

| Format             | Name   |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| `#+/-<offset_12>`                | Immediate            |
| `+/-<Rm>`                        | Register             |
| `+/-<Rm>, <shift> #<shift_imm>`  | Scaled Register      |

There are also 3 types of offset:

| Format               | Name         |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| `[<Rn>, #<offset>]`  | Offset       |
| `[<Rn>, #<offset>]!` | Pre-Indexed  |
| `[<Rn>], #<offset>`  | Post-Indexed |

The 9 combinations of these formats form the 9 possible addressing modes.

## Assembler Overview
The Assembler is broken down into multiple stages and uses multiple intermediate representations. I've found this makes the code more modular and easier to reason about. These are mostly zero-cost abstractions as they make heavy use of Rust Iterators. There is only one point where we have to take into account the entire program, which is the symbol resolution step. This is the only intermediate step where we make a complete pass of the program - it can still be considered a two-pass process, like most assemblers.

### Step 1 - Lexer
Converts a string to tokens.

### Step 2 - Parser
Converts tokens to an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), consisting of Statements. A Statement can contain a label and a comment, both optional.

The AST is a one-to-one structured representation of what the user wrote, making it easier to work with. No other alterations are made at this stage.

Example:
```
start	CMP 	R6, R4
```
gets converted to
```rs
Line {
    label: Some(
        "start",
    ),
    statement: Some(
        Instruction {
            kind: DataProcessing {
                condition: AL,
                kind: Comparison {
                    kind: CMP,
                    source: Register(
                        6,
                    ),
                    shifter: Register(
                        Register(
                            4,
                        ),
                    ),
                },
            },
        },
    ),
}
```

### Step 3 - Builder
Builds the symbol table and literal pools.


Converts the AST to a High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR) and constructs a symbol table. The Statements are converted to Instructions (with the Operands left unresolved).

In this stage, comments and empty lines are discarded, directives are applied, and psuedo-instructions are expanded. This lets us decide the final memory addresses of each instruction and piece of data.

### Step 4 - Symbol Resolver
Converts the High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR) to a Low-Level Intermediate Representation (LIR) by resolving symbols and encoding immediates.

The LIR is a one-to-one structured representation of the machine code. This is also the format used by the emulator.

### Step 5 - Encoder
Converts Instructions and Data into 32-bit words.

## Testing
There are some snapshot tests to check for regressions. These can be run using the `cargo test` command.
